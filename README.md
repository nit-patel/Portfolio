# üìÅ Project Portfolio


Welcome to my project portfolio! I am an Android and Flutter developer with over 8+ years of hands-on experience in building high-quality mobile applications. Below is a curated collection of projects I've worked on, including brief descriptions, the technologies used, and links to source code or live demos.

With more than 8 years in mobile app development and over 30+ successful projects delivered, I specialize in building high-performance Android and cross-platform applications using Flutter.

My journey began with native Android development (Java/Kotlin), and over time, I expanded into Flutter to create scalable, modern, and feature-rich apps for both Android and iOS platforms.

I've contributed to and led projects across diverse domains‚Äîe-commerce, fintech, healthtech, and social platforms‚Äîhandling end-to-end development from architecture planning to deployment and maintenance. I'm passionate about crafting seamless user experiences and writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

  </div>
</div>


**Overview:**  
ANJEL was created because too many African-American mothers (in particular) are losing their sons and daughters to senseless (and preventable) violence; because accountability for these incidents is historically low and often nonexistent; because most injury and loss of young Black Lives occurs close to home; because people want, need and deserve to know what is happening to their loved ones and where it's happening (in real-time); because the technology exists to solve this problem, and where it doesn‚Äôt, we will create it; because we are a team of People of Color who live this experience every day and do not ourselves want to become another statistic; because we have mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, brothas, sistas, nieces, nephews, aunties, and uncles just like you; because you can‚Äôt have Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness, if you don‚Äôt have and/or cannot maintain your Life; because Black Lives Matter; and because we can. So, we did! We created a Personal Security System, just for YOU. You can think of it as your own personal body camera. It‚Äôs secure. It‚Äôs mobile. It‚Äôs powerful. It‚Äôs designed and created for YOU.
